# Solar-system-by-using-opengl
A realtime 3D Solar System simulation built with PyOpenGL and GLUT (Python). This project renders the Sun, planets, and Saturn’s rings with textures, per-object transforms (rotation + revolution), basic lighting, camera controls, atmospheres, and a starfield — all designed to be instructive, easy to extend, and great for demos or course projects.
